🌐 Just Built a Modern Login Form with HTML & CSS! 🎨💻

Excited to share a simple yet powerful project I recently completed — a modern, clean, and responsive Login Form designed entirely with HTML and CSS!

🔧 What I focused on:

Minimalistic and user-friendly design

Fully responsive layout for mobile and desktop

Smooth input transitions and hover effects

Attention to spacing, alignment, and color contrast

Semantic HTML for accessibility

💡 Why this matters:
Even though login forms seem basic, they’re one of the most essential parts of any web application. Creating one from scratch helped me refine my frontend fundamentals, especially in layout techniques, responsiveness, and styling best practices.

📌 No frameworks, no libraries — just pure HTML and CSS.

🛠️ Tools Used:

HTML5

CSS3

VS Code



This is part of my ongoing journey to build a strong foundation in web development. Would love to hear your feedback or suggestions for improvement! 🚀
